      <h1>LearnZillion</h1>
      <p>
        I was among the first employees at LearnZillion and helped shape the company’s flexible learning platform that empowered school districts and teachers to meet individual needs of students.
        My work covered user research, concept development and ideation, sketching and prototyping, user testing , visual design and building the front-end in collaboration with the development team.
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt4">Search functionality</h2>
      <p>
        Internal search functionality was one of the most significant features on the site. For a long time it was where users landed first to find content and therefore was vital to our conversion rate and user engagement.
        In addition, it had to expose different types of content and the larger structure that connected them.
        This feature also allowed site admins to manage content availability for different types of users and the authors to keep track of the content they were creating.

        While designing this feature I worked closely with the development and product teams to define content structure, did multiple rounds of user testing and made sure it runs seamlessly across devices.

      <h2 class="mt4">Curriculum tree</h2>
      <p>
        While each piece of the content could be used separately, there was an underlying structure (the curriculum) that connected them. The goal was to make the curriculum structure visible so it would be easier for teachers to follow and for content authors to keep track of their work.

      <h2 class="mt4">Assignment page</h2>
      <p>
        This page housed instructional materials and practice questions that teachers could share with students with a code (called LZ code). The materials were connected and needed to be viewed at the same time.
        Given students’ limited access to devices at home and school we needed to track visitors (unauthenticated students) as well as logged in students so teachers could have an accurate account of who used the assignment.

      <h2 class="mt4">Wikipages</h2>
      <p>
        This feature allowed LearnZillion customers to arrange the content on the site based on their needs and add any additional information that made it easier to use by the end users.
        The authors of these pages were people with lots of content knowledge but no design background. The design had to be flexible and yet limiting to ensure that the final product doesn’t require additional editing.
