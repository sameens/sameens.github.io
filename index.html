    <h2>Designing for people</h2>
    <p>Ultimately, all that matters is making a difference in the lives of people, solving their problems and improving their quality of life.
  With that goal in mind, I strive to learn from people I am designing for through research-based design and continuous iterations based on testing.</p>

    <h2>Pen and pixles</h2>
    <p>Design process starts broad and messy on a piece of paper or a whiteboard.
      I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make working prototypes (for user testing) and front-end work for product features.</p>
