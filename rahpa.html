      <p>
        Rahpa is a startup that provides smart transportation solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their existing product, Panda, allowed parents and school admins to track students during their commute via school provided vehicles.
        I redesigned their native apps (for parents and drivers) and web product (used by school admins). <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        I also designed the initial flow of their new product which allowed companies to keep track and manage their field staff.
